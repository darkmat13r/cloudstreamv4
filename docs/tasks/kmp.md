# KMP — module migration

Carving `:app` into modules, restructuring `:shared`, and keeping iOS possible.

The plan is [`docs/plans/kmp-migration.md`](../plans/kmp-migration.md). This file is the work list;
the plan is the reasoning.

**The constraint behind all of it:** `app/build/classes.jar` is a binary contract that third-party
extensions compile against. It is guarded by `app/api/classes-jar.api` and `:app:checkExtensionApi`.
"No android import" does not mean movable — see `KMP-09` for the trap that caught two attempts.

## KMP-01 — B4: `DdosGuardKiller` → `:core:network`

**Status:** done · #30 · **Size:** one PR

Merged: `DdosGuardKiller` moved to `:core:network`. Added 1 sentinel to
`cloudstream.extension-api-jar.gradle.kts`; `app/api/classes-jar.api` md5 unchanged before and
after (`48709d3ac28143a2fe251ca28bcf14c1`). Local run, not CI (see `INF-01`). The checklist below is
the original plan, left as written; ticked items are the ones #30's description evidences.

Body-only change first: a private header merge replaces the call to `:app`'s
`RequestsHelperKt.getHeaders`. Adds `:library`, coroutines and `annotation` to `:core:network`.

- [ ] Run the `$stable` scan before moving (see `KMP-09`)
- [ ] Replace the `getHeaders` call with a private merge
- [x] Move, verify javap identical, `checkExtensionApi` dump unchanged (md5 above)

---

## KMP-02 — B5: `SSLTrustManager`, `DownloaderTestImpl` → `:core:network`

**Status:** blocked — needs a security review first

A **trust-all manager becomes reachable from a shared module**. That is the whole reason this is
not KMP-01's sibling. `DownloaderTestImpl` additionally needs `newpipeextractor` (already in the
catalog).

- [ ] Security review: who can reach `SSLTrustManager` after the move, and is it still only
      reachable behind the same debug/dev gate as today
- [ ] Only then: move, verify

Optional. If the review says no, close this and say why.

## KMP-03 — B6: `TestingUtils` (+8 nested) → `:core:model`

**Status:** done · #31 · **Size:** one PR

Merged: `TestingUtils` moved to `:core:model` as a pure rename — 0 lines changed, identical
sha256 on both sides. Added **9 sentinels** to `cloudstream.extension-api-jar.gradle.kts`: the
outer class plus its 8 declared nested classes (13 lines, 4 of them comment). A tenth binary name,
`TestingUtils$Logger$Message$WhenMappings`, is in the dump but deliberately **not** sentinelled —
it is a compiler-synthesised switch map for `when` over an enum, not a name an extension can
reference. `app/api/classes-jar.api` md5 unchanged (`48709d3a`) before and after `makeJar`.
Local run, not CI (see `INF-01`).

Needs `:library` and coroutines, so **not** `:core:common` (dependency rule 2). Straightforward;
it was originally bundled with B2/B3 and did not ship with them.

---

## KMP-04 — B7: `fcast/Packets.kt` → `:core:common`

**Status:** blocked by `DEC-07`

Whole file, jvmCommonMain, because `PlayMessage` uses Jackson. `:core:common` gains the
serialization plugin, kotlinx-serialization and Jackson annotations — it has no dependencies today.
No `PacketsKt` facade exists, so the eight pure classes could go to commonMain if split.

---

## KMP-05 — B8: `APIRepository` → `:core:data`

**Status:** blocked by `DEC-08`

After `KMP-01`. Inverts `MainActivity.afterPluginsLoadedEvent` in the same PR, which **removes a
public synthetic accessor from the published jar**.

- [ ] Confirm the exact removed entries and list them in the PR body
- [ ] Get sign-off in that PR, not before

## KMP-06 — Restructure `:shared`

**Status:** open · **Size:** several PRs · **Partly blocked by** `DEC-09`

The plan's "split `:shared` into `:core:ui` + `:core:designsystem`" is **stale**.
`:core:designsystem` already exists with the redesign system; merging the vendored Mihon tree into
it would collide on the name `CloudStreamTheme` — `:shared`'s installs `MaterialTheme`,
`:core:theme`'s deliberately does not.

**Measured facts this rests on:**

- 47 Kotlin files. Consumers: `:app` and `:desktopApp` only. `:core:theme`, `:core:designsystem`,
  `:core:screenshot` and `:library` reference it **zero** times in either direction.
- 83 import lines, 36 distinct symbols, 19 files. Top: `SearchableSettings` ×13, `Preference` ×7.
- All seven Compose settings screens are live nav-graph nodes
  (`app/src/main/res/navigation/mobile_navigation.xml`). **This module ships to users.**
- `:desktopApp` is one 60-line `Main.kt` rendering "Hello, World!", two buttons and a switch.
- The Mihon tree carries **seven off-4dp-step `Dp` literals** and ten hand-exported vectors, which
  would be instant violations of `dimension-scale.md` and `icons.md` in code nobody here wrote.

**Three `:shared` FQNs are frozen into the published extension ABI** — so package names must not
change through any move, and `:app:checkExtensionApi` enforces it:

| FQN | occurrences in `app/api/classes-jar.api` |
|---|---|
| `com/mihon/presentation/settings/SearchableSettings` | 17 |
| `com/lagradost/cloudstream4/compose/Screen` | 3 |
| `com/lagradost/cloudstream4/R` | 1 |

### KMP-06a — attribution, before anything moves

**Status:** done · decided 2026-09-18 (see `DEC-03`)

- [x] One `NOTICE` at the repo root plus a rewritten module README, naming Mihon, the URL,
      Apache-2.0, both copyright lines and that the files are modified
- [x] Per-file upstream mapping for all 29 files, measured by fetching each upstream file and
      diffing it
- [x] Not 29 file headers — one notice, as decided

**What the measurement changed.** All 29 files were fetched from Mihon `main` on 2026-10-07 and
diffed. Two claims in the original entry were wrong:

- *"`AppBar.kt` differs by 157 lines of 405"* — 157 is the **sum of both directions**. Ours is 405
  lines against upstream's 449: 100 upstream-only, 57 ours-only.
- *"All 16 vendored files checked differ"* — true of all 29, but **three differ in the `package`
  line and nothing else**: `material/Constants.kt`, `material/Pill.kt`, `material/Typography.kt`.
  Verified by diff: one line out, one line in. The NOTICE says so rather than implying more.

`material/SettingsItems.kt` is the honest example of real porting: `ImageVector` → Compose
`Painter`, Moko `StringResource` → Compose Resources, `Preference<T>` → `PreferenceData<T>`; 30
upstream lines removed, 46 added.

Three files are not same-name copies, which a reviewer would otherwise waste time on:
`PreferenceData.kt` ← upstream `Preference.kt` (rename), `presentation/Navigation.kt` ← upstream
`Navigator.kt` (one declaration extracted), `settings/Search.kt` ← upstream
`SettingsSearchScreen.kt` (substantial rework).

**Also established:** Mihon's `LICENSE` is the bare Apache-2.0 text naming no holder, exactly as our
vendored copy is — so that copy is faithful, not truncated. The copyright lines come from Mihon's
README: *Copyright © 2015 Javier Tomás* and *Copyright © 2024 Mihon Open Source Project*. Mihon
ships **no NOTICE file**, so §4(d) does not apply; and its sources carry **no per-file licence
headers** in any file sampled.

**Still unrecoverable:** the upstream commit the tree was taken from. It was not recorded when
vendored, and the comparison above is against a moving `main`. The module README says so and asks
whoever next updates a file to record the commit.

### KMP-06b — `:core:mihon`, the vendored tree in its own module

**Status:** open · after `KMP-06a`

29 `.kt` under `com/mihon/**` moved as-is, packages unchanged, plus its `LICENSE` and `readme.md`.
One module, one licence, one `NOTICE`. Keeping it separate is what makes it obvious that a
different standard applies there — because a different licence does.

- [ ] Decide whether `com/mihon/common/preference/**` goes to `:core:storage` or stays.
      Recommended: **stays**, so one licence lives under one root. Those five files are Compose-free.

### KMP-06c — `:core:ui` for the first-party Compose layer

**Status:** open · after `KMP-06b`

`com/lagradost/cloudstream4/compose/**` and `theme/**`. Takes the `publicResClass` FQN
`com.lagradost.cloudstream4.generated.resources` — exactly one module may hold it, because two `Res`
classes at one FQN collide on the classpath (`cloudstream.kmp.compose.gradle.kts` exists to prevent
this).

- [ ] `Viewmodel.kt` moves rather than being deleted. It is unreferenced *by code* but designated
      foundation *by rule*: `.claude/rules/mvi-viewmodel.md` names it as the MVI primitives for every
      `:core:*` and `:feature:*` module not yet written.
- [ ] `DEC-09` decides whether `BaseComposeFragment` comes along.

### KMP-06d — retire `:shared`

**Status:** blocked until 06b and 06c land

---

## KMP-07 — `:media:model` skeleton

**Status:** open · contracts only, no implementation

---

## KMP-08 — Track L: `:library` iOS surgery

**Status:** blocked by `DEC-04`

Needs a design workflow before any code. Cannot be scoped until the iOS extension strategy is
decided, because that decides how much of `:library` is worth making iOS-compilable.

---

## KMP-09 — The `$stable` trap (reference, not a task)

Kept here because it has already cost two attempts.

The Compose compiler emits `public static final int $stable` on every class it processes. Moving a
class to a module **without** the Compose compiler silently drops that field — an ABI break that
reads as an innocent file move. Worse: when a class moves to a *different* Compose module, a
constant `$stable` becomes `getstatic Other.$stable`, which changes the runtime value while the ABI
dump looks identical.

- PR #4 dropped `$stable` on four classes and the PR body claimed signatures were unchanged. #5 fixed
  it with the `cloudstream.kmp.extension-api` convention plugin.
- B2 dropped three auth DTOs for exactly this reason; B3 proved them safe and moved them.

**Always run the `$stable` scan before claiming a move is signature-neutral.** An ABI dump diff
alone does not catch the cross-module case.
